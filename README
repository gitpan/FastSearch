Text::FastSearch.pm

Text::FastSearch.pm provides fast string search subroutines that use
strategies of the Boyer-Moore search algorithm to find patterns within
strings of any length with little overhead for longer patterns or
subject text, and without the time and memory overhead of Perl's
regular expression pattern matching.
